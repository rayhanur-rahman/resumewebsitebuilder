1. Till now our progress is less than expected. We were stuck in some technological issues. For instance, our knowledge over node.js is not at an advanced stage.  
2. We wanted to merge branches individually and thatâ€™s why a lot of conflicts occurred. So now we have decided to merge the conflicts together so that such conflicts can be handled efficiently.
3. We have to arrange more scrum meetings in a week. Now we decide to meet in every alternate day. This increases accountability in each of us and everyone remains in check and balance by others in the group.

1. The implementation of extracting data from a dblp profile has to be redone. It did not comply with the purpose of what we want to do.
2. We have to understand the promise API.

## 11/1/2019
1. We overestimated the progress of the project, that is why there are still some tasks in the to do list. 
2. Two of the tasks are already done. We just need to close those issues.
3. The API of LinkedIn was restricted unlike GitHub or DBLP. That is why extracting data from LinkedIn profile according to the bot API was a time consuming process. So we had to change the approach by which we want to extract the data.
